Do your research and ask for support if you have any questions or issues before trying random things on the internet because "it's the internet". If you do, YOU are choosing to follow random things on the internet, and if YOU point the finger at us for messing up your device, WE will laugh at you.

So please backup your data and have a plan B in case things break (unlikely, but it happens more than you know).
